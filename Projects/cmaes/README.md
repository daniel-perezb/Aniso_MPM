## TODO
- [ ] File locations were changed for easier readability of code. Check if they are correct
- [ ] Update CMA-ES so that it can only run using deformation path and no image comparison
- [ ] Check if all data for code is in one folder
- [ ] Update README 
- [ ] Update github with matlab code for fibre detection 

## Code description 

This is the opensource code for the following papers:

(1) Non-rigid image registration for elastoplastic materials using physics-based simulation, Daniel Perez, Raphael Falque, Alen Alempijevic 

The paper above utilises the material simulation implemented below for obtaining material's properties of fleece:

(2) AnisoMPM: Animating Anisotropic Damage Mechanics, Joshuah Wolper, Yunuo Chen, Minchen Li, Yu Fang, Ziyin Qu, Jiecong Lu, Meggie Cheng, Chenfanfu Jiang (SIGGRAPH 2020)
